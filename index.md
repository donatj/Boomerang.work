# Introduction

Boomerang*!* is an easy to use API surface testing framework. It is written in PHP and is composer compatible.

Inspired by [Frisby.js](http://frisbyjs.com/), Boomerang*!* takes API testing a step further by allowing easy iteration of values, validation of individual hops along a set of redirects, using a more reliable, extensible architecture.

## Does API surface testing replace unit testing?

*No*, not at all.  It is meant to be used in conjunction with a proper unit test suite for an enhanced test sweep.
